Description: Provides some easy-to-use functions to extract and visualize the
    output of descriptive data analysis for more sophisticated approaches e.g.,
    robust statistics, smart scale-rescale transformation, and rigorous 
    descriptions of data considering location, scale, and shape of 
    distributions. The authors' intention is to create a toolbox to facilitate 
    the use of various descriptive statistical functions and resources in favor
    of an easier, scientifically recognized standard for implementing R 
    statistical applications. We will try to provide multi-control knob tools,
    by means of various options and incorporating the most available rigorous 
    methods.
