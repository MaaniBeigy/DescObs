# DescObs
Tools for Versatile Exploration of Data.

`DescObs` stands for **descriptive observation**. 
We do not want just to see, we *observe*! 

# Overview
## Background
There are lots of R packages with statistical functions of particular use cases.
Despite the growing body of these packages and repositories which hase been
quite useful for scientists, the redundancy and multiplicity of these packages
make it sometimes very difficult to choose between them. Morover, adding 
methods and features to those functions are not feasible due to uncompliance of 
some packages to the well-known conventions of functional and/or OO programming. 
## Aims
The authors' intention is to create a toolbox to facilitate the use of various 
descriptive statistical functions and resources in favor of an easier, 
scientifically recognized standard for implementing R statistical applications. 
We will try to provide *multi-control knob tools*, by means of various 
**options**  and incorporating the most available rigorous methods.
