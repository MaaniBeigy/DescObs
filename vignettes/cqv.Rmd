# Coefficient of Quartile Variation   
Coefficient of quartile variation *($CQV$)* is a measure of relative dispersion  that is based on interquartile range (`IQR`). Since *cqv* is unitless, it is 
useful for comparison of variables with different units. It is also a measure of homogeneity [@Bonett2006; @Altunkaynak2018].
